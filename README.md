This is the backend of my Location App project. I decided to create the project using the MERN stack, and this backend in deployed onto Heroku. The frontend of this application is deployed on
github pages. The main challenge of this project was its size, this is a fully functioning application so it took a longer time to learn how to manage all of the files. Overall, it was a rewarding experience
and I feel that I learned a lot about Node.js through this project.
